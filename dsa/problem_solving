A systematic strategy for solving the problem:

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. Comment it out in words.
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.

This seemingly obvious strategy will help you solve almost any programming problem you will face in an interview or coding assessment. 

The objective of this course is to rewire your brain to think using this method, by applying it over and over to different types of problems. This is a course about thinking about problems systematically and turning those thoughts into code.
